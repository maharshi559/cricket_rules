			<h3>Playing Rules</h3>
			<img src="bg2.jpg" style="float:left;">
			<ol>
				<li>A coin toss is held by the team captains (who are also players) just before the match starts: the winner decides whether to bat or field first.</li>
				<li>The two batsmen take positions at opposite ends of the pitch, the one who faces the ball is termed as <b> Striking Batsmen</b> and the batsmen at the other end is known as <b>Non Striker</b>.
</li>
				<li>If bowler crosses the crease before he releases the ball, or if he flexes his elbow too much in a throw, then it is a no ball,</li>
				<li> If the ball passes the far wicket out of reach of the batsman then it is called a wide, 
</li>
				<li> The batsman cannot be dismissed, and the batting team gets a penalty or extra run for wide an No ball.
</li>
				<li>If the bowler succeeds in putting down the wicket the batsman is dismissed and is said to be bowled out.
</li>
				<li>If the batsman hits the ball but it is caught by a fielder without bouncing then he is caught out. If it is caught by the bowler then he is caught and bowled; by the wicket keeper, caught behind.</li>
				<li>By attempting runs, the batsmen risk dismissal. This happens if the fielding team retrieves the ball and hits either wicket with the ball (either by throwing it, or while holding it) before the batsman who owns that wicket reaches his ground behind the crease. The dismissed batsman is run out. Batsmen will sometimes start to run, change their minds, and return to their original positions.
</li>
				<li>If the batsman misses the ball they can still attempt extra runs : these are called byes. If the ball bounces off his body then it is called a leg bye.
</li>
				<li>After a bowler has bowled six times (an over), another member of the fielding team is designated as the new bowler, the old bowler taking up a fielding position. 
</li>
				<li>After a bowler has bowled six times (an over), The batsmen stay in place, and the new bowler bowls to the opposite wicket, so the roles of striker and non-striker reverse. 
</li>
				<li>The innings is complete when 10 of the 11 members of the batting team have been dismissed (all out â€“ although one always remaining "not out"), when a set number of overs has been played, or when the batting team declares that they have enough runs.</li>
				<li>The number of innings and the number of overs per innings vary depending on the format of the match. </li>
